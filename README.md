## Hey, I’m Trinity Christiana.  
Technical polymath. Jazz musician. Recovering perfectionist. Currently building tools that make tech more human.

I’m a Nashville native who graduated college at 16, got paid to code by 20, and now help others do the same.

I build full-stack applications, teach rising devs, and co-lead **Repped School by Repped in Tech**—a movement for underestimated folks learning to take up space in tech.  

My goal? To make sure the next generation of Black techies knows it’s *very* possible to hit six figures *before* 25. With style.  

Right now I’m focused on building:  
- **Repped School**, a learning platform for folks rewriting their tech journey  
- **Tools & automations** that make learning, hiring, and creating easier  


## What I Know My Way Around:

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Gatsby, Webpack, Sass, Bootstrap, Redux, jQuery, HTML/CSS  
- **Backend**: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Firebase, GraphQL, MySQL  
- **Tools**: Git, Jenkins, PowerShell, Figma, Terminal magic, CircleCI, VS Code keyboard wizardry  

## What I Stand For:

- People over prestige  
- Access over gatekeeping  
- Clarity over chaos  
- Mission over metrics  
- And joy—always joy
